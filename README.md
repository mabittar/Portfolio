# Marcel Bittar
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

*My passion in technology and programming skills drive me to start a new knowledgment area in Computer Engineering. I uses this repo to track my projects.*

But I always work with large urban infrastructure and heavy civil projects like Metro Sao Paulo (Line 2 and 5), Metro Salvador, GRU Airport, LEED Platinum commercial building;
from the mobilization phase until its delivery. Deploying management systems with follow up productivity, planning and costs indicators, sizing teams and equipment to meet the deadline and customer requirements, also acted in preparation of Technical and Commercial documents request for proposal and final Analysis Proposals.




**Background in:** Python, Machine Learning, infrastructure and heavy projects.

## Contents

- ### Deep Learning
   * [Traffic Sign Recognition](https://github.com/mabittar/Portfolio/blob/master/Reconhecendo_Sinais_Tr%C3%A2nsito.ipynb): Using Convolutinal Network recognize traffic signs. The model obtained 95% accuracy during training and above 80% in the test. I also used a random sign directly from the web to check if the model would correctly identify it.

- ### Machine Learning
    * [Default Risk](https://github.com/mabittar/Portfolio/blob/master/Risco_Inadimpl%C3%AAncia.ipynb): A Machine Learning model to identify whether a customer is possibly unable to meet his obligations (default risk) and consequently affect credit risk and thus interest rates.
    * [Churn Rate](https://github.com/mabittar/Portfolio/blob/master/Churn_Predict.ipynb): Analysis of Churn Rate with differents ML models: XGboost, SVC, Decision Tree, Voting Method. Tunning hyperparameters with Grid Search (manual) and BayesSearchCV (automatic). At least I used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain what's influence more the ML model.
    * [Ensemble Method](https://github.com/mabittar/Portfolio/blob/master/ML11_Ensemble.ipynb): Using ensemble method to optimize diferents ML models to classify an makrting campaing
    * [Fraud Detection on Credit Card Transactions](https://github.com/mabittar/Portfolio/blob/master/Detec%C3%A7%C3%A3o_de_Fraude_em_CC.ipynb): Comparison of metrics assessment using logistic regression and decision tree to identify fraud in credit card transactions
    * [Single / Multiple Linear Regression](https://github.com/mabittar/Portfolio/blob/master/ML2_Regressao_Linear.ipynb): Using an Kraggle dataset to analysis house price prediction. Evaluating R2 score, MSE and MAE to compare single / multiple regression

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation

   * [Panorama of Covid-19](https://github.com/mabittar/Portfolio/blob/master/Panorama_do_COVID_19_no_Mundo.ipynb): Using an dataset from World in Data to explore the panorama of Covid-19 in world.
   * [WordClouds from AirBnB data](https://github.com/mabittar/Portfolio/blob/master/Wordcloud.ipynb) : Another way to display data. Using wordclouds to analysis data of AirBnB sumarary.
   * [Data analysis from AirBnB in Rio de Janeiro](https://github.com/mabittar/Portfolio/blob/master/Analise_de_Dados_dispon%C3%ADvel_no_Airbnb.ipynb): Analysis of AirBnB data from Rio de Janeiro and its implications
   * [Analyzing Violence in Rio de Janeiro](https://github.com/mabittar/Portfolio/blob/master/Analisando_a_Viol%C3%AAncia_no_Rio_de_Janeiro.ipynb) : Exploratory Analysis of the violance data in RJ.
